/* DOM Manipulation: Independent Practice

To complete this excercise, you must meet the following requirements:

- Change the value of the element with the name id to be whatever the user inputs when page first loads.
- When the user clicks the "#new-thing-button" button, add whatever is in the input box to the "#fav-list" list.
- Clear the input box when the user clicks the button.
- Bonus: only add item if the input box is not blank (hint: check innerHTML property)
